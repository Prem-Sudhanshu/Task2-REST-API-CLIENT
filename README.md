## Task 2 involves developing a Java application that consumes a public REST API and presents the fetched data in a well-structured and readable format. This task is designed to introduce interns to HTTP-based communication, one of the key concepts in modern web and mobile development.

The application should be able to:

Send HTTP GET requests to a public API (such as a weather, currency exchange, or COVID-19 data API).

Receive and handle JSON responses from the server.

Parse and display the retrieved data in a user-friendly format (console output or GUI is acceptable).

Interns are expected to use Java libraries such as java.net.HttpURLConnection, BufferedReader, and JSON parsing tools like org.json, Gson, or Jackson. This task not only strengthens understanding of Javaâ€™s networking and parsing capabilities but also mirrors real-world use cases where data from external APIs is integrated into applications.

The deliverable is a Java program that correctly handles HTTP requests and parses JSON responses efficiently. Proper error handling (for network issues or unexpected data formats) and clean code with descriptive comments are essential.

By completing this task, interns will gain practical experience with RESTful web services, which is crucial for developing connected systems like mobile apps, dashboards, and cloud-based tools. This hands-on project enhances the ability to interact with real-time data and prepares developers for integrating third-party services in future projects.

As with other tasks, the solution should be documented clearly and stored in a GitHub repository. Interns are encouraged to use online platforms like YouTube, Google, and ChatGPT to explore solutions and best practices while completing the task efficiently.
